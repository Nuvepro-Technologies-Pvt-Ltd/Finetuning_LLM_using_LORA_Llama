# README: Summarizing Conversations with a Fine-Tuned Language Model

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive guide to fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for the task of conversation summarization. It walks you through the entire process, from loading and preprocessing the dataset, configuring and training the model, to inference and sharing your model on the Hugging Face Hub.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning concepts.
- Familiarity with NLP and language models is helpful but not required.

## Setup and Installation
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face's `transformers` and `datasets` libraries
- Other dependencies mentioned in the notebook

You can install most of these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets
```
