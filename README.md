# README: Summarizing Conversations with a Fine-Tuned Language Model

# Introduction

Demand forecasting predicts future sales or demand for a product.  Large language models can also be finetuned on demand forecasting using historical data and text like customer reviews. The model learns contextual relationships in the data to make accurate forecasts. Finetuning is done on smaller datasets relevant to the specific forecasting task. This produces a customized model for time series forecasting that outperforms classical methods. The approach is data-efficient and can account for complex real-world variables. Finetuned models provide a promising new approach to demand sensing and forecasting in many industries.
