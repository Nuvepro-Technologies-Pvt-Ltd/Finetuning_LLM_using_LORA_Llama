Guided Python Notebook: Summarizing Conversations with a Fine-Tuned Language Model
Introduction
This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for the task of summarizing conversations. We'll use the DialogSum dataset and the Llama-2 7b model, fine-tuned with LoRA adaptations.

Setup and Dependencies
python
Copy code
import torch
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, TrainingArguments
from trl import SFTTrainer
Include instructions on installing necessary libraries.

Part 1: Loading and Preprocessing Data
Loading the DialogSum Dataset
python
Copy code
huggingface_dataset_name = "knkarthick/dialogsum"
dataset = load_dataset(huggingface_dataset_name)
Task: Preprocess the Dialog-Summary Dataset
Preprocessing steps will be outlined here.

python
Copy code
# Task: Implement the preprocessing function here
Part 2: Model Setup
Loading the Base Model
python
Copy code
model_id = "/opt/Llama-2-7b"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, ...)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
Task: Prepare Model for Training
Instructions on preparing the model for training.

Part 3: Training the Model
Setting up Training Arguments
python
Copy code
training_arguments = TrainingArguments(...)
Task: Train the Model
Detailed instructions on how to train the model.

Part 4: Inference and Evaluation
Zero-shot Inference with the Base Model
python
Copy code
# Code for zero-shot inference
Task: Perform Inference with the Trained Model
python
Copy code
# Instructions and code for inference with the trained model
Part 5: Merging and Uploading the Model
Merging Trained LoRA Adapter with Base Model
python
Copy code
# Code for merging models
Task: Push the Merged Model to Hugging Face Hub
Instructions on how to push the model to the hub.
