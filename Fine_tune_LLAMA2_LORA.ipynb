# **Guided Python Notebook: Summarizing Conversations with a Fine-Tuned Language Model**

## Introduction
This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for the task of summarizing conversations. We'll use the DialogSum dataset and the Llama-2 7b model, fine-tuned with LoRA adaptations.

## Setup and Dependencies
```python
import torch
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, TrainingArguments
from trl import SFTTrainer
```
_Include instructions on installing necessary libraries._

## Part 1: Loading and Preprocessing Data

### Loading the DialogSum Dataset
```python
huggingface_dataset_name = "knkarthick/dialogsum"
dataset = load_dataset(huggingface_dataset_name)
```

### Task: Preprocess the Dialog-Summary Dataset
_Preprocessing steps will be outlined here._

```python
# Task: Implement the preprocessing function here
```

## Part 2: Model Setup

### Loading the Base Model
```python
model_id = "/opt/Llama-2-7b"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, ...)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
```

### Task: Prepare Model for Training
_Instructions on preparing the model for training._

## Part 3: Training the Model

### Setting up Training Arguments
```python
training_arguments = TrainingArguments(...)
```

### Task: Train the Model
_Detailed instructions on how to train the model._

## Part 4: Inference and Evaluation

### Zero-shot Inference with the Base Model
```python
# Code for zero-shot inference
```

### Task: Perform Inference with the Trained Model
```python
# Instructions and code for inference with the trained model
```

## Part 5: Merging and Uploading the Model

### Merging Trained LoRA Adapter with Base Model
```python
# Code for merging models
```

### Task: Push the Merged Model to Hugging Face Hub
_Instructions on how to push the model to the hub._
