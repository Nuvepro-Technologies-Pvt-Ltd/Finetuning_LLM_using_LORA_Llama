# **Guided Python Notebook: Summarizing Conversations with a Fine-Tuned Language Model**

## Introduction
[...Introductory text...]

## Setup and Dependencies
[...Dependency setup code...]

## Part 1: Loading and Preprocessing Data

### Loading the DialogSum Dataset
[...Dataset loading code...]

### **Try Out**: Preprocess the Dialog-Summary Dataset
Now it's your turn! Try modifying the preprocessing function to customize how the dataset is prepared for the model. Experiment with different approaches to see how they affect the model's performance.

```python
# Your custom preprocessing code here
```

## Part 2: Model Setup

### Loading the Base Model
[...Model loading code...]

### **Try Out**: Prepare Model for Training
Modify the settings for preparing the model. Experiment with different configurations and see how they impact training.

```python
# Your model preparation code here
```

## Part 3: Training the Model

### Setting up Training Arguments
[...Training arguments code...]

### **Try Out**: Train the Model
Adjust the training parameters or the model's architecture and start the training. Observe how different settings affect the training process and the final model performance.

```python
# Your training code here
```

## Part 4: Inference and Evaluation

### Zero-shot Inference with the Base Model
[...Inference code...]

### **Try Out**: Perform Inference with the Trained Model
Use the trained model to generate summaries. Experiment with different dialogues to see how well the model performs.

```python
# Your inference code here
```

## Part 5: Merging and Uploading the Model

### Merging Trained LoRA Adapter with Base Model
[...Model merging code...]

### **Try Out**: Push the Merged Model to Hugging Face Hub
Now it's your turn to push the merged model to the Hugging Face Hub. Follow the instructions and try uploading the model.

```python
# Your model upload code here
```
